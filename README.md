`npm install`
`pm2 start puppeteer.js`

This project is running in an Ec2 instance 24/7.
I will push the files here during the nigth.
Only files inside data folder are trusted.
The code is very simple and need more improvements.
I didn't create the code to retrieve all countries because Europe, Americas are async.
Must spend some time on that.
